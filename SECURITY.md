# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible. We request that you please follow these guidelines:

* Contact the lead maintainer directly, providing as much relevant information as possible about the vulnerability.
* Please report the vulnerability responsibly by using the
  [Report a vulnerability][vulnerability] link, if available.
  Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

## Policy

* We take the security of our software product very seriously.
* Every report is thoroughly investigated by a set of dedicated developers.
* We appreciate your patience as we work to verify the vulnerability and, if necessary, prepare a fix.
* We strive to keep all our users updated with the latest information about any security issues that we find.

Thank you for helping to keep our project and our users safe!
